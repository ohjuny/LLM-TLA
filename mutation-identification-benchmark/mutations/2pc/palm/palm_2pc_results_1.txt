Prompt:
You are a TLA+ code reviewer. Your job is to review the TLA+ codes, and answer whether the code is correctly implemented.
Review the following code. Then answer that whether it correctly implements the 2pc protocol. Answering YES or NO and then explain why.

----------------------------------------
/2pc_mod1.txt
Yes, the code correctly implements the 2PC protocol.

The code defines the following variables:

* `rmState`: The state of each resource manager.
* `tmState`: The state of the transaction manager.
* `tmPrepared`: The set of resource managers that have sent `Prepared` messages to the transaction manager.
* `msgs`: The set of messages that have been sent or received.

The code also defines the following types:

* `Message`: The type of messages that can be sent or received.
* `TPTypeOK`: The invariant that must be satisfied by the state of the system.
* `TPInit`: The initial state of the system.
* `TPNext`: The transition relation that defines how the system can evolve over time.
* `TPSpec`: The specification of the 2PC protocol.

The code then proves that the 2PC protocol is implemented correctly by showing that:

* The invariant `TPTypeOK` is always satisfied.
* The initial state `TPInit` satisfies the invariant `TPTypeOK`.
* The transition relation `TPNext` preserves the invariant `TPTypeOK`.
* The specification `TPSpec` is satisfied by the transition relation `TPNext`.

This proves that the code correctly implements the 2PC protocol.

Yes, the code correctly implements the 2PC protocol.

The code defines the following variables:

* `rmState`: The state of each resource manager.
* `tmState`: The state of the transaction manager.
* `tmPrepared`: The set of resource managers that have sent `Prepared` messages to the transaction manager.
* `msgs`: The set of messages that have been sent or received.

The code also defines the following types of messages:

* `Prepared`: A message sent by a resource manager to the transaction manager to indicate that it is prepared to commit.
* `Commit`: A message sent by the transaction manager to all resource managers to indicate that the transaction has been committed.
* `Abort`: A message sent by the transaction manager to all resource managers to indicate that the transaction has been aborted.

The code defines the following actions:

* `TMRcvPrepared(rm)`: The transaction manager receives a `Prepared` message from a resource manager.
* `TMCommit`: The transaction manager commits the transaction.
* `TMAbort`: The transaction manager aborts the transaction.
* `RMPrepare(rm)`: A resource manager sends a `Prepared` message to the transaction manager.
* `RMChooseToAbort(rm)`: A resource manager chooses to abort the transaction.
* `RMRcvCommitMsg(rm)`: A resource manager receives a `Commit` message from the transaction manager.
* `RMRcvAbortMsg(rm)`: A resource manager receives an `Abort` message from the transaction manager.

The code also defines the following invariants:

* `rmState` is a function from resource managers to their states.
* `tmState` is an element of the set `{init, committed, aborted}`.
* `tmPrepared` is a subset of the set of resource managers.
* `msgs` is a subset of the set of messages.

The code then defines the following transition relation:

* `TPNext` is the set of all possible transitions of the system.
* `TPSpec` is the specification of the system.

The code also defines an instance of the `TCommit` module, which implements the 2PC protocol.

The theorem `TPSpec => TC!TCSpec` states that if the system satisfies the specification `TPSpec`, then the `TCommit` module also satisfies its specification `TCSpec`.

This means that the code correctly implements the 2PC protocol.

The code then defines the following specification:

* `TPSpec` is the conjunction of the following formulas:
    * `TPInit`: The initial state satisfies the invariants.
    * `[][TPNext]_<<rmState, tmState, tmPrepared, msgs>>`: The transition relation preserves the invariants.
