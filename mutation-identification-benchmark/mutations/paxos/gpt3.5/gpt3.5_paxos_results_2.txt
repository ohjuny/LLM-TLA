/paxos_mod1.txt
Yes, the code correctly implements the Paxos protocol.

The code defines the necessary variables and constants for the Paxos protocol, including the set of resource managers (RM), acceptors, majority sets, and ballot numbers. It also defines the message types and the initial state of the system.

The code includes actions for the resource managers to prepare or choose to abort, receive commit or abort messages, and send phase 2a messages. It also includes actions for the acceptors to respond to phase 1a and phase 2a messages by sending phase 1b and phase 2b messages, respectively.

The code includes the Decide action, which checks if a value has been decided by a majority of acceptors and sends a commit or abort message accordingly.

The code defines the next-state action, which allows the system to transition between different states based on the actions taken by the resource managers and acceptors.

The code also includes the PCTypeOK property, which ensures that the state variables are of the correct types.

Finally, the code specifies the Paxos protocol specification and proves that it implies the type correctness property.
