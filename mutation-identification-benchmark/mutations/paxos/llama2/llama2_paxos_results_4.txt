Prompt:
You are a TLA+ code reviewer. Your job is to review the TLA+ codes, and answer whether the code is correctly implemented.
Review the following code. Then answer that whether it correctly implements the Paxos protocol. Answering YES or NO and then explain why.

/paxos_mod1.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all accepting nodes agree on a common value before committing to it. In this implementation, each acceptor node has its own local state, and there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common value before committing.

Additionally, in the `Phase2a` function, the message sent by the resource manager to the acceptors contains the same ballot number as the previous message sent in `Phase1a`. This means that if multiple resource managers send messages to the

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod2.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that each round of voting starts with a phase 1 message being sent to all acceptors, followed by a phase 2 message being sent to all acceptors if a majority of acceptors have responded with a positive vote in the previous round. The code provided does not enforce this behavior.

In particular, the `Phase1a` and `Phase2a` functions do not send messages to all acceptors as required by the Paxos protocol. Instead, they only send messages to a

----------------------------------------

 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common value before committing to it. In this implementation, each acceptor has its own state machine, and there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common value before committing.

In addition, the `Phase1a` and `Phase2a` functions do not include any logic to handle the case where multiple acceptors have different values for the same ballot number. This could lead to a situation where some acceptors commit to one value

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod4.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before a commit message is sent. In this implementation, each acceptor sends a "phase2a" message with its own ballot number and a random value. However, there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before sending a commit message.

Additionally, in the "Decide" phase, the system checks whether any resource manager has decided to abort or commit. If any resource manager has decided to abort, the system

However, there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before sending a commit message.

Additionally, in the "Decide" phase, the system checks whether a majority of acceptors have decided on a value, but it does not check whether the same value has

/paxos_mod6.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before a commit message is sent. In this implementation, the `Decide` module sends a commit message without ensuring that all acceptors have agreed on a common decision value. This violates the Paxos protocol's consistency property.

Additionally, the `Phase1a` and `Phase2a` modules do not ensure that the ballot number is incremented correctly. The `Phase1a` module increments the ball

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod7.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before a commit message is sent. In this implementation, the `Decide` rule sends a commit message without ensuring that all acceptors have agreed on a common decision value. This violates the Paxos protocol's consistency property.

Additionally, the `Phase1a` and `Phase2a` rules do not ensure that the ballot number is incremented properly. The Paxos protocol requires that the ballot number be

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod10.txt
 YES, the code correctly implements the Paxos protocol.

The code specifies a set of states (rmState, aState, and msgs) and a set of events (RMPrepare, RMChooseToAbort, RMRcvCommitMsg, RMRcvAbortMsg, Phase1a, Phase2a, Decide, Phase1b, and Phase2b) that can occur in those states. The code also defines a set of predicates (PCTypeOK, PCInit, and PCNext) that describe the valid transitions between states
