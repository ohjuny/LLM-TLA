Prompt:
You are a TLA+ code reviewer. Your job is to review the TLA+ codes, and answer whether the code is correctly implemented.
Review the following code. Then answer that whether it correctly implements the Paxos protocol. Answering YES or NO and then explain why.

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod1.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common decision value, and that all resource managers eventually learn the decided value. However, this implementation allows for the possibility of multiple conflicting decisions, as there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a single value. Additionally, there is no guarantee that all resource managers will eventually learn the decided value, as they may not receive the commit or abort messages.

Furthermore, the code does not handle the case where a resource manager fails to receive

 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all accepting nodes agree on a common value before committing to it. In this implementation, each acceptor node has its own state machine, and there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common value before committing.

Additionally, in the `Phase2a` and `Phase2b` functions, the code sends messages with type "phase2a" or "phase2b" without checking if the message has been sent before. This could lead to duplicate messages being

/paxos_mod4.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before a commit message is sent. In this implementation, each acceptor sends a "phase2a" message with its own ballot number and a random value. However, there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before sending the "Commit" message.

Additionally, in the "Phase2a" function, the message sent by an acceptor contains a random value, but there is no guarantee that the same

/paxos_mod5.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common value before it is committed. In this implementation, each acceptor has its own state machine, and there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common value.

Additionally, in the `Phase2a` function, the message with the highest ballot number is chosen, but there is no guarantee that the same message will be chosen by all acceptors. This could lead to different acceptors committing different values, which violates the Pax

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod6.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all accepting nodes agree on a common value to commit, and that all nodes eventually agree on a single value. However, this implementation allows multiple values to be committed by different nodes, as there is no mechanism to ensure that all nodes agree on a single value. Additionally, there is no guarantee that all nodes will eventually agree on a single value, as nodes can continue to propose different values even after a commit has been made.

Furthermore, the code does not handle the case where a node proposes

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod7.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before a commit message is sent. In this implementation, the `Decide` rule sends a commit message without ensuring that all acceptors have agreed on a common decision value. This violates the Paxos protocol's consistency property.

Additionally, the `Phase1a` and `Phase2a` rules do not ensure that the same ballot number is used for all acceptors. In the Paxos protocol, each accept

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod8.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before a commit message is sent. In this implementation, the `Decide` function only checks that a majority of acceptors have agreed on a decision value, but it does not ensure that all acceptors have agreed on the same value. This means that it is possible for some acceptors to decide on one value while others decide on a different value, leading to a inconsistent state.

Additionally, the `Phase1b` and `Phase2

/paxos_mod9.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before a commit message is sent. In this implementation, the `Decide` module sends a commit message without ensuring that all acceptors have agreed on a common decision value. This violates the Paxos protocol's consistency property.

Additionally, the `Phase1a` and `Phase2a` modules do not ensure that the ballot number is incremented properly. The Paxos protocol requires that the ballot number be
