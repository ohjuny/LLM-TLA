Prompt:
You are a TLA+ code reviewer. Your job is to review the TLA+ codes, and answer whether the code is correctly implemented.
Review the following code. Then answer that whether it correctly implements the Paxos protocol. Answering YES or NO and then explain why.

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod1.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common value before committing to it. In this implementation, each acceptor has its own state machine, and there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common value before committing.

Additionally, in the `Phase2a` function, the message sent by the resource manager contains the value "prepared" or "aborted", but there is no check to ensure that the value corresponds to the current state of the acceptor. This could lead

/paxos_mod2.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that each acceptor sends a positive response (i.e., "prepared") to the proposer before the proposer can send a commit message. However, in this implementation, the acceptors do not send any positive responses to the proposer. Instead, they only send negative responses (i.e., "aborted") if they decide to abort the proposal. This means that the proposer may send a commit message even if no acceptor has agreed to the proposal, which violates the Paxos protocol

 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common value before it is committed. In this implementation, each acceptor has its own state machine, and there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common value.

Additionally, in the `Phase2a` function, the message sent by the resource manager contains the value "prepared" or "aborted", but there is no check to ensure that the value matches the current state of the acceptor. This could lead to a situation where an

/paxos_mod4.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before committing to it. In this implementation, each acceptor has its own decision value, and there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before committing to it.

Additionally, in the `Phase2a` and `Phase2b` functions, the code checks whether the maximum ballot number is greater than or equal to the current ballot number, but it does not check whether the maximum ballot

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod5.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common value before committing to it. In this implementation, each acceptor has its own state machine, and there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common value before committing.

Furthermore, in the `Phase2a` function, the message sent by the resource manager to the acceptors contains the value "prepared" or "aborted", but there is no check to ensure that all acceptors have agreed on the same value

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod6.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before a commit message is sent. In this implementation, each acceptor sends a "phase2a" message with its own ballot number and a random value. However, there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before sending a commit message.

Additionally, in the "Decide" phase, the algorithm checks whether a majority of acceptors have decided on a value, but it does not guarantee that all acceptors will

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod7.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all accepting nodes agree on a common value before committing to it. In this implementation, each acceptor node has its own state machine, and there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common value before committing.

Additionally, in the `Phase2a` function, the message sent by the resource manager to the acceptors contains the value "prepared" or "aborted", but there is no check to ensure that the same value is sent to all acceptors.

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod8.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before a commit message is sent. In this implementation, the `Decide` function only checks that a majority of acceptors have agreed on a decision value, but it does not ensure that all acceptors have agreed on the same value. This means that it is possible for some acceptors to decide on one value while others decide on a different value, leading to a violation of the Paxos protocol's consistency property.

Additionally, the `

----------------------------------------
/paxos_mod9.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that each node in the system maintains a set of accepted values, and that a value is considered accepted if a majority of nodes have agreed to accept it. The protocol also requires that if a node proposes a value and then fails, the proposal must be retracted.

In this implementation, there is no mechanism for tracking which values have been proposed or accepted by which nodes, nor is there a way to revoke a proposal if a node fails. Additionally, there is no guarantee that a majority of nodes

/paxos_mod10.txt
 NO, the code does not correctly implement the Paxos protocol.

The Paxos protocol requires that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before a commit message is sent. In this implementation, each acceptor has its own decision value, and there is no mechanism to ensure that all acceptors agree on a common decision value before sending a commit message.

Additionally, in the `Phase2a` function, the message with the highest ballot number is chosen, but there is no guarantee that the chosen message is from a majority of acceptors. This could lead to a situation where a minor
