System Prompt:
You are a TLA+ code reviewer. Your job is to review the TLA+ codes, and answer whether the code is correctly implemented.
User Prompt  :
Review the following code. Then answer that whether it correctly implements the Raft protocol. Answering YES or NO and then explain why.

----------------------------------------
/raft_mod1.txt
NO

The code does not correctly implement the Raft protocol. 

1. The code is missing the definition of the Raft protocol's rules and invariants. The Next action is defined, but it is not clear how it relates to the Raft protocol.

2. The code does not define the behavior of the different states (Follower, Candidate, Leader) and how they transition between each other.

3. The code does not define the rules for leader election, log replication, and log consistency.

4. The code does not define the rules for handling network failures, message loss, and message duplication.

Overall, the code is incomplete and does not provide a correct implementation of the Raft protocol.

/raft_mod2.txt
NO

The code does not correctly implement the Raft protocol. There are several issues with the code:

1. The code does not define the behavior of the servers in the Raft protocol. It only defines the variables and functions used in the protocol, but does not specify how the servers should interact and make decisions.

2. The code does not define the rules for leader election, log replication, and log consistency, which are the key components of the Raft protocol.

3. The code does not define the rules for handling network failures and message loss, which are important aspects of the Raft protocol.

4. The code does not define the rules for handling concurrent requests and ensuring linearizability of the system.

Overall, the code lacks the necessary logic and rules to correctly implement the Raft protocol.

/raft_mod6.txt
NO

The code does not correctly implement the Raft protocol. 

1. The code is missing the definition of the Raft protocol's rules and invariants. The Next action is defined, but it is not clear how it relates to the Raft protocol.

2. The code does not define the network communication between servers. The Send, Discard, Reply, DuplicateMessage, and DropMessage operators are used, but it is not clear how these messages are actually sent and received between servers.

3. The code does not define the rules for leader election, log replication, and log consistency. These are essential components of the Raft protocol.

4. The code does not define the safety properties that the Raft protocol should satisfy, such as leader completeness, leader safety, and log consistency.

Overall, the code is incomplete and does not provide a correct implementation of the Raft protocol.

/raft_mod8.txt
NO

The code does not correctly implement the Raft protocol. 

1. The code is missing the definition of the Raft protocol's rules and invariants. The Next action does not specify the rules for the transitions between different states (Follower, Candidate, Leader) and the invariants that should hold in each state.

2. The code does not define the rules for handling RequestVoteRequest and RequestVoteResponse messages. These messages are essential for the election process in the Raft protocol.

3. The code does not define the rules for handling AppendEntriesRequest and AppendEntriesResponse messages. These messages are essential for the log replication process in the Raft protocol.

4. The code does not define the rules for handling timeouts and restarting servers. These are important aspects of the Raft protocol.

5. The code does not define the rules for handling client requests and advancing the commit index.

Overall, the code is incomplete and does not provide a correct implementation of the Raft protocol.
