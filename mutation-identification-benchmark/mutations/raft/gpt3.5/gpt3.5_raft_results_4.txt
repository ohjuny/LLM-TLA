System Prompt:
You are a TLA+ code reviewer. Your job is to review the TLA+ codes, and answer whether the code is correctly implemented.
User Prompt  :
Review the following code. Then answer that whether it correctly implements the Raft protocol. Answering YES or NO and then explain why.

----------------------------------------
/raft_mod1.txt
NO

The code does not correctly implement the Raft protocol. 

1. The code is missing the definition of the Raft protocol's rules and invariants. The Next action is defined, but it is not clear how it relates to the Raft protocol.

2. The code does not define the behavior of the different states (Follower, Candidate, Leader) and how they transition between each other.

3. The code does not define the rules for leader election, log replication, and log consistency.

4. The code does not define the rules for handling network failures, message loss, and message duplication.

Overall, the code is incomplete and does not provide a correct implementation of the Raft protocol.

/raft_mod2.txt
NO

The code does not correctly implement the Raft protocol. There are several issues with the code:

1. The code does not define the behavior of the system in terms of states and transitions. The Next operator is defined, but it is not used in the specification. The behavior of the system should be defined using the Next operator to specify the possible transitions between states.

2. The code does not define the Raft protocol's rules for leader election, log replication, and log consistency. These rules are essential for implementing the Raft protocol correctly.

3. The code does not define the network communication between servers. The Raft protocol relies on network communication between servers to exchange messages and perform leader election and log replication. The code should include definitions for sending and receiving messages between servers.

4. The code does not define the safety properties that the system should satisfy. The specification should include safety properties such as leader completeness, log consistency, and safety properties related to leader election.

Overall, the code is incomplete and does not correctly implement the Raft protocol. It lacks the necessary definitions for states, transitions, network communication, and safety properties.

The code does not correctly implement the Raft protocol. 

1. The code is missing the definition of the Raft protocol's rules and invariants. The Next action is defined, but it is not clear how it relates to the Raft protocol.

2. The code does not define the behavior of the servers in different states (Follower, Candidate, Leader) and how they transition between states.

3. The code does not define the rules for leader election, log replication, and log consistency.

4. The code does not define the rules for handling network failures, message loss, and message duplication.

Overall, the code lacks the necessary details and logic to correctly implement the Raft protocol.

/raft_mod8.txt
NO

The code does not correctly implement the Raft protocol. 

1. The code is missing the definition of the Raft protocol's rules and invariants. The Next action does not specify the rules for the transitions between different states (Follower, Candidate, Leader) and the invariants that should hold in each state.

2. The code does not define the network communication between servers. The Send, Discard, Reply, and Receive actions are incomplete and do not specify how messages are sent and received between servers.

3. The code does not handle the case where a server receives a RequestVoteRequest or AppendEntriesRequest message with a higher term than its current term. According to the Raft protocol, the server should update its term and transition to the Follower state.

4. The code does not handle the case where a server receives a RequestVoteResponse or AppendEntriesResponse message with a stale term. According to the Raft protocol, the server should ignore the response if it has already transitioned to a higher term.

5. The code does not handle the case where a server receives conflicting AppendEntriesRequest messages. According to the Raft protocol, the server should reject the conflicting entries and truncate its log.

Overall, the code is incomplete and does not fully implement the Raft protocol.
