System Prompt:
You are a TLA+ code reviewer. Your job is to review the TLA+ codes, and answer whether the code is correctly implemented.
User Prompt  :
Review the following code. Then answer that whether it correctly implements the Raft protocol. Answering YES or NO and then explain why.

----------------------------------------
/raft_mod1.txt
NO

The code does not correctly implement the Raft protocol. 

1. The code is missing the definition of the Raft protocol's rules and invariants. The Next action is defined, but it is not clear how it relates to the Raft protocol.

2. The code does not define the behavior of the different states (Follower, Candidate, Leader) and how they transition between each other.

3. The code does not define the rules for leader election, log replication, and log consistency.

4. The code does not define the rules for handling network failures, message loss, and message duplication.

Overall, the code is incomplete and does not provide a correct implementation of the Raft protocol.

/raft_mod2.txt
NO

The code does not correctly implement the Raft protocol. There are several issues with the code:

1. The code does not define the behavior of the servers in the Raft protocol. It only defines the variables and functions used in the protocol, but does not specify how the servers should interact and make decisions.

2. The code does not define the message passing mechanism between the servers. It only defines the variables for storing messages, but does not specify how the messages should be sent and received.

3. The code does not define the rules for leader election, log replication, and log consistency in the Raft protocol. These are essential components of the protocol, but are not implemented in the code.

4. The code does not define the safety and liveness properties of the protocol. It only defines the initial state and the possible next states, but does not specify the desired properties that the protocol should satisfy.

Overall, the code is incomplete and does not correctly implement the Raft protocol.

/raft_mod8.txt
NO

The code does not correctly implement the Raft protocol. 

1. The code is missing the definition of the Raft protocol's rules and invariants. The Next action does not specify the rules for the transitions between different states (Follower, Candidate, Leader) and the invariants that should hold in each state.

2. The code does not define the network communication between servers. It is missing the Send and Receive actions that handle the sending and receiving of messages between servers.

3. The code does not define the handling of RequestVote and AppendEntries messages. The actions HandleRequestVoteRequest, HandleRequestVoteResponse, HandleAppendEntriesRequest, and HandleAppendEntriesResponse are incomplete and do not handle all the necessary cases.

4. The code does not define the leader election process. It is missing the rules for the leader election and the handling of votes.

5. The code does not define the log replication process. It is missing the rules for appending entries to the log and replicating the log across servers.

Overall, the code is incomplete and does not correctly implement the Raft protocol.

----------------------------------------
/raft_mod9.txt
NO

The code does not correctly implement the Raft protocol. There are several issues with the code:

1. The code does not define the behavior of the system in terms of states and transitions. It only defines a set of variables and operations on those variables, but it does not specify how those variables should change over time.

2. The code does not define the network communication between servers. It only defines the behavior of individual servers, but it does not specify how servers should send messages to each other or how they should handle incoming messages.

3. The code does not define the rules for leader election, log replication, or log consistency. These are key components of the Raft protocol, but they are not implemented in the code.

4. The code does not define the safety properties that the system should satisfy. It does not specify what it means for the system to be correct or how to verify that correctness.

Overall, the code is incomplete and does not provide a correct implementation of the Raft protocol.
